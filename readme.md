## üéÆ About This Project

This repository aims to be a comprehensive resource for Android users with **Mali GPUs** who want to play Windows games using emulators like **Winlator** and **GameHub**. The goal is to create a community-driven database of what games are playable, and what specific settings are required to get them running smoothly.

**Download Emulators:**

[![Download GameHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download-GameHub-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=android)](https://gamehub.xiaoji.com/)
[![Download Winlator](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download-Winlator-green?style=for-the-badge&logo=github)](https://github.com/brunodev85/winlator/releases)

Due to the unique challenges of Mali GPUs compared to their Adreno counterparts, finding working configurations can be difficult. This project seeks to solve that by providing detailed, user-submitted reports.
